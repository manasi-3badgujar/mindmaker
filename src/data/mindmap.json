  "summary": "Vitamins are organic micronutrients that play a vital role in maintaining normal metabolic processes, supporting growth and development, and preserving overall health. Although required only in small quantities, vitamins are indispensable for enzyme function, immune defense, tissue repair, and cellular communication. The human body cannot synthesize most vitamins in sufficient amounts, making dietary intake essential. Adequate vitamin consumption helps prevent deficiency-related disorders, supports long-term well-being, and enhances resistance to infections and chronic diseases.",

      "title": "Vitamin Classification",
      "summary": "Vitamins are broadly classified based on their solubility characteristics, which directly influence how they are absorbed, transported, stored, and eliminated in the body. This classification helps in understanding dietary requirements, potential risks of deficiency, and the likelihood of toxicity. The two primary categories—fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins—differ significantly in their physiological behavior and nutritional management.",

          "title": "Fat-Soluble Vitamins",
          "summary": "Fat-soluble vitamins dissolve in dietary fats and are absorbed along with lipids in the digestive tract. They are primarily stored in the liver and adipose tissues, allowing the body to retain them for extended periods. While this storage capability reduces the risk of frequent deficiency, excessive intake can lead to toxicity. Proper regulation of fat-soluble vitamin intake is therefore crucial for maintaining health.",
